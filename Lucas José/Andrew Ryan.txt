Even in the book of lies sometimes you find truth. There is indeed a season for all things and now that I see you flesh to flesh and blood to blood I know I cannot raise my hand against you. But know this: you are my greatest disappointment. Does your master hear me? Atlas! You can kill me, but you will never have my city. My strength is not in steel and fire, that is what the parasites will never understand. A season for all things: a time to live and a time to die. A time to build....AND A TIME TO DESTROY!
